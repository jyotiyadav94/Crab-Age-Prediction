# About Dataset

## Context
The dataset is used to estimate the age of the crab based on the physical attributes. 
It's a great starting point for classical regression analysis and feature engineering to understand the impact of feature engineering in the Data Science domain.

## Content
Crab is very tasty, and many countries of the world import a huge amount of crabs for consumption every year. 
The main benefits of crab farming are low labor cost, comparatively lower production cost, and fast growth. 
Commercial crab farming business is developing the lifestyle of the people in coastal areas. By proper care and management, we can earn more from crab farming business than shrimp farming. 
Mud crabs can be raised in two systems: Grow out farming and fattening systems.

## Inspiration
For a commercial crab farmer, knowing the right age of the crab helps them decide if and when to harvest the crabs. 
Beyond a certain age, there is negligible growth in the crab's physical characteristics, so it is important to time the harvesting to reduce cost and increase profit. The goal of the dataset is:

- Exploratory data analysis: Understand how different physical features change with age.
- Feature Engineering: Define new features using a combination of given data points to help improve model accuracy.
- Regression Model: Build a regression model to predict the age of the crab.
